## Overview

### The challenge

Stay updated with the latest news using the News Homepage! This webpage features a dynamic homepage layout for a news website, providing users with customized news based on their preferences and the latest breaking news presented in a structured manner. Users can view the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size and interact with hover and focus states for all interactive elements.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project is a special one as the features of this project can force a developer to think hard on implementing everything seamlessly in a responsive layout using the tech stack he/she prefers. Following code snippet is one such example from my `script.js` file to change design of a component using DOM manipulation of this homepage.

```js
const navOpenBtn = document.querySelector('#nav-open');
const navCloseBtn = document.querySelector('#nav-close');
const mobileNavCont = document.querySelector('[data-mobile-only]');

navOpenBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  mobileNavCont.style.display = 'block';
});

navCloseBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  mobileNavCont.style.display = 'none';
});
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in JavaScript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
